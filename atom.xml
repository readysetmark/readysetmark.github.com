    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since graduating from university, I&rsquo;ve somehow managed to avoid having to do
much in the way of frontend web programming. I&rsquo;ve done work on the backend
side of a webapp, including writing an HTTP server and handling data synchronization,
but I&rsquo;m out of touch or just clueless when it comes to things like HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, jQuery, and anything related.</p>

<p>However, since I&rsquo;ve got a personal project that I want to write as a webapp, and
also because we&rsquo;re ramping on web development projects at work, the time has
come for me to get a good handle the parts of web development that have so far
eluded me.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I spent about four days intensely reading and typing out
the code in <a href="http://www.eloquentjavascript.net">Eloquent JavaScript</a>.
I found it to be a good read and a nice introduction to writing JavaScript.</p>

<p>As way to continue my learning and get accustomed to writing JavaScript code, I
decided to reproduce a neat little text game found in the book <a href="http://www.landoflisp.com">Land of Lisp</a>
by Conrad Barski. In the book, the game is called &ldquo;Orc Battle&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;ve called
my version &ldquo;Monster Battle&rdquo;, which seems more appropriate to me, because you
fight more than orcs.</p>

<p>Functionally, it is pretty much the same game, though I had to handle prompting
the user for input a bit differently, since on the web you can&rsquo;t just stop
mid-function and wait for the user to type something (the original game was
written for a console window).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.readysetmark.com/monsterbattle/">Play</a> the game, or checkout the
<a href="http://www.github.com/readysetmark/monster-battle-js">code</a> on github.</p>
