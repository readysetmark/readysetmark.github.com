Hello there!

I'm a software developer living in Winnipeg, Canada. I have a curiosity for
non-mainstream programming languages and what they have to teach, and I'm keen 
to improve my chops as a developer. There's always more to learn.

Fitness kickboxing has become an important part of my life. I'm not a fighter, 
but I do appreciate the health benefits. It's a fantastic, but very demanding
workout.

Feel free to get in touch. I'd love to hear from you.
